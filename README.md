# LinkedIn Profile Data Fetcher

This repository contains a Python script that fetches LinkedIn profile data using the Proxycurl API and processes it. The script sends a request to the Proxycurl API and retrieves various details about a LinkedIn profile, including the user's name, occupation, headline, summary, experience, education, and skills.

## Instructions for Script Usage

1. **Set Up**:
    - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Proxycurl API key in the script.
